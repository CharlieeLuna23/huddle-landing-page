### What I learned

I learned how to use SVC images however I would like to practice them more as I'm still inexperienced with them.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s84jDjZQkLI&ab_channel=IrvineMesa) - This helped me understand how to work with SVC images for the social media icons.
